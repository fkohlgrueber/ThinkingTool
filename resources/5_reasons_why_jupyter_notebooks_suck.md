# 5 reasons why jupyter notebooks suck

(Source)[https://medium.com/@alexander.mueller/5-reasons-why-jupyter-notebooks-suck-4dc201e27086]

jupyter notebook pain points:

- notebooks do not play nice with git
- missing IDE features (linting, code formatting)
- hard to test
- non-linear workflow, running wrong cell can destroy whole state
- bad for long asynchronous tasks

*Bottom line:* jupyter notebooks are great for initial exploration, but should not be used for more complex stuff.
